N-body simulation is numerically integrating the point-point interactions of N particles. In this case simulation of stars via gravitation.

I will follow the ruby 2-body tutorial that is on : 
http://www.artcompsci.org/kali/vol/two_body_problem_1/ch01.html

and for the code

c_#_#.rb means Chapter # Section #

so c_2_4.rb is Chapter 2 Section 4

Basically the Ruby .rb files contain scripts that are run as is, following the tutorial template, with some deviations in interesting directions also.
The Comparison folders contain doc and image outputs of the n-body trajectories, when I was comparing different integration methods.
